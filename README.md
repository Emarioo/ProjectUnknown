# ProjectUnknown
A game made with C++, OpenGL, GLEW, GLFW3, ReactPhysics3D and OpenAL.

This project is very unorganized at the moment. This is due to some changes I am making to
the build system. The changes should allow the game to run on Windows and Linux.

## Building
There will be instructions on how to compile and run the game. But there aren't
because of the changes.

## Other notes
The source files for GLFW3, GLEW and RP3D are directly included in the project which isn't necessary. 
Premake is used to generate project files (gmake, vs2022).
Visual studio code and Visual studio is used when working on the project.
