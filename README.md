# ProjectUnknown
A game made with C++, OpenGl, ReactPhysics3D and OpenAL.

This project will be split into two repositories.
Engone and ProjectUnknown. ProjectUnknown is the code name for the game and will be private
once it has more content. Engone will be public.

The project is not very organized at the moment. The source files for GLFW3, GLEW and RP3D 
are directly included in the project which isn't necessary. Changes to the build system are
being done so that the project can be compiled on Linux and not just Windows.
Premake is used to generate project files (gmake, vs2022).
Visual studio code and Visual studio is used when working on the project.
Things are messy because I am trying to find a neat way of doing things.
