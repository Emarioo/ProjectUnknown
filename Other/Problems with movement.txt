Problems with movement

Attempt 1
	Apply force in the direction the player is looking at
	acceleration is fast but the player's velocity has a maximum
	using high friction and low bounce to stop the player.
	damping would effect gravity which isn't what i want.
Issues:
	Cannot go up slopes very well.
	How to fix. if touch slope boost up a bit? increase bounce?
	Works, but that boost is maintained once you've reached the top
	which causes you to fly up in the air.
