- You float down from the sky with blue particles blocking your vision. You don't know what they are but you realize that this new world is unfamiliar. (Here you can skip the tutorial)

- The blue particles begin to communicate with you by telling you it's name, Kevin(spirit like name). He tells you to gather **sticks, fiber and flint** to be crafted into tools. The world is not friendly and if you want to survive you require weapons, food and shelter.
(Quest on the side showing the necessary ingredients for ax, pickax and sword, more dialog about the crafting system)

- After crafting tools and a means to defend yourself as instructed by the mysterious Kevin you decide to explore the area. After a bit of walking you find a few creatures. As you approach, their hostility radiates and Kevin teaches you how to fight. Since you are new to fighting Kevin slows down the time.
(Enemies are spawned either naturally or by the tutorial. Enemies will not spawn naturally before this point. The world generation will also not spawn any dungeons or the place you start will at least not be dangerous)

- If you die at any point before making a **Soul Binder** you respawn where you floated down from the sky. Kevin gets mad at you for dying so quickly and explains how this world works differently from others when it comes to death. Your soul escapes your dead body with your memories, skills and recipes but your physical items stay where you died without any precautions such as a **Soul Binder**.

- If you didn't die Kevin explains some stuff about the items the enemies dropped.
